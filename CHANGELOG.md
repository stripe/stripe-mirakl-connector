# Changelog

## Version 3.0.2
- Fix URL generation when behind a proxy.

## Version 3.0.1

- Bumped dependencies.

## Version 3.0.0
- Seller onboarding flow has been migrated from Oauth to Connect Onboarding. Make sure to configure your [Connect branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect) before upgrading. You can also disable OAuth for Express accounts in your â€™[Connect settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/connect).
- Consequently, the `/api/onboarding` endpoint has been removed, the `AccountOnboarding` entity has been deleted, and the `STRIPE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable is no longer needed.
- The `connector:sync:onboarding` command no longer uses the delay parameter. This parameter is now deprecated, please remove it from your crontab settings.
- You can now use the `SCHEME` environment variable to force HTTP when working locally or in a development environment.
- The `BASE_HOST` environment variable must now be strictly without the scheme as a prefix, i.e. there must be no `https://` preceding the domain.
- Stripe accounts are now created during the onboarding job and mapped with the corresponding Mirakl shop.
- Auto debit of negative balances is now disabled by default for new Stripe accounts (see #78).
- Improved Controllers tests.

- Breaking changes to the environment variables:
  - Default payment metadata key for the payment validation is now `mirakl_commercial_order_id`. The connector will keep using your custom metadata key if you set one. This only affects users relying on the payment validation workflow and with no set `MIRAKL_METADATA_ORDER_ID` variable.
- Breaking changes to resources exposed by the connector API:
  - Resource: renamed `StripeCharge` entity to `PaymentMapping`.
  - Resource: removed `TRANSFER_INVALID_AMOUNT` status from `StripeTransfer`.
  - Resource: added `*_ABORTED` and `*_ON_HOLD` statuses to `StripeTransfer`, `StripePayout` and `StripeRefund`.
  - Resource: added `type` to `StripeRefund`.
  - Notification: `stripePayoutId` in the `payout.failed` notification has been deprecated in favor of `payoutId`.
  - Notification: added `type` to `payout.failed`.
