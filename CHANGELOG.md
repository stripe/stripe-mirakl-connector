# Changelog

## Version 2.0.1

- Fixed: use commercial ID in refund workflow instead of order ID to fetch the payment ID.

## Version 2.0.0

- Added: config service to better manage workflows checkpoints.
- Added: "on hold" and "aborted" statuses for better backlog management.
- Added: support for service orders by the payment split and validation workflows.
- Fixed: `account.updated` event will now result in 200 OK if the account is not on Mirakl.
- Fixed: captured amount for refused/cancelled orders
- Breaking changes to the environment variables:
  - Default payment metadata key for the payment validation is now `mirakl_commercial_order_id`. The connector will keep using your custom metadata key if you set one. This only affects users relying on the payment validation workflow and with no set `MIRAKL_METADATA_ORDER_ID` variable.
- Breaking changes to resources exposed by the connector API:
  - Resource: renamed `StripeCharge` entity to `PaymentMapping`
  - Resource: removed `TRANSFER_INVALID_AMOUNT` status from `StripeTransfer`
  - Resource: added `*_ABORTED` and `*_ON_HOLD` statuses to `StripeTransfer`, `StripePayout` and `StripeRefund`
  - Resource: added `type` to `StripeRefund`
  - Notification: `stripePayoutId` in the `payout.failed` notification has been deprecated in favor of `payoutId`
  - Notification: added `type` to `payout.failed`
