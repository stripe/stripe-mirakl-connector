Stripe provides a connector to allow marketplaces powered by Mirakl to onboard sellers on Stripe and pay them out automatically.

Learn how to use the connector in the [Stripe Docs](https://stripe.com/docs/plugins/mirakl).

## Containerized examples

Deploying the application manually can be non-trivial and sometimes unstable. We recommend using containerization instead.

For Docker users, you can find an example under [examples/docker](examples/docker).

Feel free to share a working example using your favorite tool via a pull request.

## Contributing to the application

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests accordingly.
